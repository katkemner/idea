# COMPASS – AI Workforce Optimization Platform

## Project Summary

COMPASS is a modular AI system designed to simulate and optimize workforce decisions in enterprise environments. It combines employee digital twins, predictive simulations, and dynamic scenario modeling to improve performance, reduce costs, and support strategic planning.

---

## Goals

- Create digital representations (twins) of employees using multimodal data.
- Simulate strategic HR scenarios (layoffs, reorganizations, upskilling).
- Optimize decisions using user-defined constraints (e.g., cost, retention, DEI).
- Integrate with enterprise HR platforms (Workday, SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Viva).

---

## Core Features

- ✅ **Digital Twin Engine** – builds behavioral & skill-based employee models.
- ✅ **Anti-Twin Simulation** – generates inverse profiles to assess risk/collaboration mismatches.
- ✅ **Scenario Simulator** – uses Monte Carlo + agent-based modeling to test org changes.
- ✅ **User-Weighted Optimization** – allows decision-makers to define tradeoff priorities.
- ✅ **Explainability Layer** – SHAP/LIME for transparent predictions and decisions.

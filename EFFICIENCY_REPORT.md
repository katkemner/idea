## Identified Efficiency Issues

### 1. Inefficient Data Processing with Nested Loops
**Location**: `compass/digital_twin.py:create_employee_twin()`
**Severity**: High
**Issue**: Multiple nested loops for feature extraction instead of vectorized operations
```python
# INEFFICIENT
for key in employee_data.keys():
    if key != 'employee_id':
        for subkey in employee_data[key] if isinstance(employee_data[key], dict) else [employee_data[key]]:
            # Processing logic
```
**Impact**: O(n²) complexity for feature extraction
**Recommendation**: Use pandas DataFrame operations and numpy vectorization

### 2. Redundant Statistical Calculations
**Location**: `compass/digital_twin.py:create_employee_twin()`
**Severity**: High
**Issue**: Recalculating mean and std for each feature normalization
```python
# INEFFICIENT
for i in range(len(feature_array)):
    normalized_features.append((feature_array[i] - np.mean(feature_array)) / np.std(feature_array))
```
**Impact**: O(n²) time complexity, repeated calculations
**Recommendation**: Calculate statistics once, use sklearn StandardScaler

### 3. Inefficient String Processing
**Location**: `compass/digital_twin.py:_extract_skills()`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: Character-by-character string processing with nested loops
```python
# INEFFICIENT
for word in skill_text.split():
    for char in word:
        if char.isalpha():
            continue
    cleaned_word = ''.join([c for c in word if c.isalpha()])
```
**Impact**: O(n*m) where n=words, m=characters per word
**Recommendation**: Use regex or string methods for bulk processing

### 4. Expensive Mathematical Operations in Loops
**Location**: `compass/digital_twin.py:_calculate_collaboration_score()`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: Expensive exp, log, sin operations in nested loops
```python
# INEFFICIENT
score = np.exp(np.log(abs(value) + 1)) * np.sin(value) ** 2
```
**Impact**: Unnecessary computational overhead
**Recommendation**: Simplify mathematical expressions, vectorize operations

### 5. Memory Inefficient Data Structures
**Location**: `compass/digital_twin.py:_extract_performance_metrics()`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: Creating large intermediate lists and redundant calculations
```python
# INEFFICIENT
all_values = []
for key in perf_data:
    if isinstance(perf_data[key], list):
        all_values.extend(perf_data[key])
# Multiple passes through all_values
```
**Impact**: Excessive memory usage, multiple data passes
**Recommendation**: Use numpy arrays, calculate statistics in single pass

### 6. Lack of Batch Processing
**Location**: `compass/digital_twin.py:batch_create_twins()`
**Severity**: High
**Issue**: Processing employees individually instead of batch operations
```python
# INEFFICIENT
for employee_data in employees_data:
    twin = self.create_employee_twin(employee_data)
    time.sleep(0.001)  # Unnecessary delay
```
**Impact**: Linear scaling instead of vectorized processing
**Recommendation**: Implement true batch processing with pandas/numpy

### 7. Inefficient Model Predictions
**Location**: `compass/digital_twin.py:predict_attrition()`
**Severity**: High
**Issue**: Individual predictions and model refitting for each employee
```python
# INEFFICIENT
for emp_id in employee_ids:
    features = np.array(self.employee_twins[emp_id]['features']).reshape(1, -1)
    self.attrition_model.fit(features, dummy_target)  # Refitting each time!
```
**Impact**: Exponential time complexity, unnecessary model training
**Recommendation**: Batch predictions, pre-trained models

### 8. Inefficient Random Sampling
**Location**: `compass/scenario_simulator.py:simulate_layoff_scenario()`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: Inefficient random sampling with list operations
```python
# INEFFICIENT
for _ in range(num_layoffs):
    chosen = random.choice(remaining_employees)
    laid_off.append(chosen)
    remaining_employees.remove(chosen)  # O(n) operation
```
**Impact**: O(n²) complexity for sampling
**Recommendation**: Use numpy.random.choice without replacement

### 9. Redundant Similarity Calculations
**Location**: `compass/scenario_simulator.py:_calculate_similarity()`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: Multiple set operations and manual distance calculations
```python
# INEFFICIENT
skills1 = set(twin1.get('skills', []))
skills2 = set(twin2.get('skills', []))
intersection = len(skills1.intersection(skills2))
union = len(skills1.union(skills2))
```
**Impact**: Redundant set operations, manual distance calculation
**Recommendation**: Use scipy.spatial.distance, cache similarity matrices

### 10. Inefficient Team Optimization
**Location**: `compass/scenario_simulator.py:simulate_reorganization()`
**Severity**: High
**Issue**: Nested loops for team evaluation with redundant calculations
```python
# INEFFICIENT
for i, member1 in enumerate(member_ids):
    for j, member2 in enumerate(member_ids):
        if i < j:
            similarity = self._calculate_similarity(...)  # O(n²) per team
```
**Impact**: O(n³) complexity for team evaluation
**Recommendation**: Pre-compute similarity matrices, use graph algorithms

### 11. Manual Statistical Aggregation
**Location**: `compass/scenario_simulator.py:_aggregate_simulation_results()`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: Manual calculation of statistics instead of using optimized libraries
```python
# INEFFICIENT
for key in results[0].keys():
    values = []
    for result in results:
        values.append(result[key])
    aggregated[f'{key}_mean'] = sum(values) / len(values)
```
**Impact**: Multiple data passes, inefficient memory usage
**Recommendation**: Use pandas DataFrame.describe() or numpy statistical functions

### 12. Inefficient Monte Carlo Optimization
**Location**: `compass/scenario_simulator.py:monte_carlo_optimization()`
**Severity**: High
**Issue**: Random search without guided optimization or early stopping
```python
# INEFFICIENT
for iteration in range(num_iterations):
    # Random configuration generation
    config = {}
    # No guided search or convergence criteria
```
**Impact**: Poor convergence, wasted computational resources
**Recommendation**: Use genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or gradient-based methods

## Conclusion

The current COMPASS implementation contains significant efficiency bottlenecks that limit its scalability. The identified issues primarily stem from:

1. **Algorithmic inefficiencies** - Using O(n²) or O(n³) algorithms where linear alternatives exist
